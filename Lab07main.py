'''
Name: Shubham Mohole
Program: The first function is a helper function which takes the .py file with the vertices and edges and creates a
graph using the GraphAdjList module. The second function is main random walks function. Once we have made sure that
the starting vertex is in the graph we get the list of neighbors of the starting vertex. We then randomly select one of
those neighbors to set the current vertex as. We repeat this process knowing that if we do get to a dead end our program
will just go backward since no vertex is isolated completely.
